# Tedds Timber Design

This application is meant to be bundled into a single file executable that forms part of the backend for the [Timber Structural Design Software](https://github.com/SeifFahmy/timber-structural-design).

It accepts JSON that represent the design data timber structural members should be designed to (e.g. spans and loads), then connects to Tekla Tedds using its API to perform structural calculations to Eurocode 5.
